# countdown-to-ibiza

<b>Purpose:</b> the purpose of this site was spurred on from a WhatsApp conversation with friends, where one asked how long it was until our trip to Ibiza later this year, 
and I thought, why not build something that automated this question for us!

So I built it and deployed it live here: http://returnofthedc10ers.com/

<b>Languages used:</b>
- html: very basic divs layout to enable css responsiveness
- css: media queries for top iPhone users, Google fonts (Space Mono love!), loving the css gradients again!
- JavaScript: basic script I lifted and shifted from the web as a countdown, slightly modified logic to adapt what I needed.

<b>What I learnt:</b>
- Had a MASSIVE issue with Google fonts that tooks hours to debug. Imported the fonts as normal (worked before), however the changes would not reflect on Mobile, 
but worked fine on desktop.  After posting to StackOverflow, someone informed me I needed to map the font detail to the @font-face rule (which I had never heard of)
and then it worked straight away.  
- Learnt how to purchase a domain name and link to GitHub page, which was not as straightforward as I would have thought. Had to declare the 'A' and 'C NAME' DNS
attributes, and then link back in GitHub Pages.  Not hugely straightforward for a novice.
- Learnt tonnes more on media queries and getting it to look right on mobile.  Loving this side of things a lot!
- Learnt how to add favicons to the site.  I used some tool which spammed loads of stuff into the html, which on reflection, looks messy.
